## üí° **INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Why CarRacing Succeeded**
- **Continuous control**: Better suited for gradual optimization
- **Visual complexity**: Rich environment provides good training signal
- **Action space**: 3 continuous actions allow fine-grained control
- **Reward structure**: More frequent positive rewards than Atari games

### **Atari Challenges Identified**
- **Sparse rewards**: Pong/Breakout have very sparse reward signals
- **Discrete actions**: Limited action exploration compared to continuous
- **Deterministic**: Less exploration variety in discrete action games

### **Next Steps for Improvement**
1. **Increase population size** for Atari environments (current: 8‚Üí16)
2. **Longer training** - CarRacing showed it can learn, needs more generations
3. **Reward shaping** - Consider auxiliary rewards for Atari games
4. **Curriculum ordering** - Start with CarRacing to build better world models

TRAINING EXECUTION STATUS
================================================================================

PHASE COMPLETED: Environment Setup & VAE Implementation
- ✅ Repository root confirmed and working directory set
- ✅ Python 3.12 with PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121 installed
- ✅ Gymnasium environments and dependencies installed
- ✅ Dynamic VAE created and tensor issues resolved
- ✅ GPU optimizations enabled and verified

TRAINING ATTEMPTS:
1. FULL_FIXED Run:
   - Status: Data collection completed (50/50 episodes at 2.19 it/s)
   - GPU Memory: AMP + TF32 optimizations active
   - Issue: Disk space exhaustion during data save (0 GB free)

2. CLASSIC_FIXED Run:
   - Status: Data collection in progress (10/50 episodes)
   - GPU Memory: Same optimizations active
   - Issue: Terminated due to same disk space issue

================================================================================
FAILURE ANALYSIS: DISK SPACE EXHAUSTION
================================================================================

ROOT CAUSE: C: drive completely full (0 GB free space)
- Training data for World Models is extremely large (4.34 GB per environment)
- Random episode collection generates massive frame datasets
- Windows system drive cannot accommodate training data

IMMEDIATE IMPACT:
❌ Cannot save training data (numpy.savez fails with OSError: [Errno 28])
❌ Cannot complete VAE training phase
❌ Cannot proceed to MDN-RNN or Controller training
❌ No analysis outputs generated

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Pong episode data: ~4.34 GB for 50 random episodes
- Frame resolution: 64x64x3 (configurable, was using default)
- Data format: Compressed numpy arrays (.npz files)
- Each curriculum task requires similar data volumes

================================================================================
SOLUTIONS & NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS (User Action Required):
1. FREE DISK SPACE:
   - Delete temporary files, old downloads, unused programs
   - Move OneDrive files offline or to external storage
   - Clear browser cache, system temp files
   - Target: Need at least 20-30 GB for complete curriculum

2. MOVE WORKSPACE:
   - Relocate project to external drive with more space
   - Update paths in training scripts accordingly
   - Ensure external drive has adequate speed for GPU training

3. REDUCE DATA REQUIREMENTS:
   - Use smaller VAE image size (--vae-img-size 32 instead of 64)
   - Reduce episode count per environment (modify collect_random_data)
   - Implement more aggressive data compression
   - Use --quick True for reduced thresholds and faster training

OPTIMIZED RESTART COMMAND (when space available):
```

  --device cuda \
  --max-generations 100 \
  --amp True \
  --tf32 True \
  --episodes-per-eval 3 \

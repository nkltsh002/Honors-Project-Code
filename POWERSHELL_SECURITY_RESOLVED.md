# PowerShell Security Issue Resolution

## ✅ SOLVED: Windows PowerShell Execution Policy

The Windows security issue preventing PowerShell wrapper execution has been **completely resolved**.

## Applied Solution

**Set execution policy for current user (no admin privileges required):**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Verification

✅ **PowerShell wrapper now works perfectly:**
```powershell
PS> .\wm.ps1 --version
Repository root: C:\Users\User\OneDrive - University of Cape Town\Honors\New folder
Using virtual environment Python
Python 3.12.0

PS> .\wm.ps1 world_models\curriculum_trainer_visual.py --quick True
# Runs curriculum trainer with proper CWD and virtual environment
```

## Additional Solutions Available

### 1. **Automated Setup Script**
```powershell
.\setup_powershell.ps1
```
- Checks current policy
- Offers to apply recommended settings
- Tests wrapper functionality

### 2. **One-time Bypass** (if policy can't be changed)
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\wm.ps1 <arguments>
```

### 3. **Batch File Alternative** (no security restrictions)
```cmd
wm.bat <arguments>
```

## Security Context

- **RemoteSigned**: Allows locally created scripts, requires signature for downloaded scripts
- **Scope CurrentUser**: Only affects current user, no admin privileges required
- **Safe**: Maintains security while enabling local development scripts

## Current Status

**✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- PowerShell wrapper: `.\wm.ps1` works
- Batch wrapper: `wm.bat` works
- Automatic virtual environment detection
- Proper repository root management
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained

The Windows security issue has been completely resolved with multiple fallback options provided.
